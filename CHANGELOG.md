0.1.7
* Fix audio listener not properly tracking ghost camera when player is dead

0.1.6
* "Fix" audio spatialization by playing audio as if the camera is still inside the player. 
<br>NOTE: This will make SFX significantly louder for those that used earlier versions of this mod.
* Add option to turn audio spatialization fix off in config

0.1.5
* Cleared out some crufty config variables
* Disabling the mod mid-game should be less glitchy (you still need to start a new game to fully turn it off)

0.1.4
* Updated instructions again because it's working now??

0.1.3
* Updating instructions to point at manual BepinEx install.

0.1.1

0.1.0
* Plugin disabled while I figure out why it's broken

0.0.2
* Documentation updated (sort of)

0.0.1
