# Stable Third Person Camera
Adds smoothed out third-person tracking to the player.
Press *N* (configurable) to toggle the camera on/off in-game. Note that this toggle may be unstable and you might need to restart Peak to get it working right.

# Features and Configuration
Coming soon, maybe.. just trying to get it to work right now.

# Known Issues
* No handling for readable objects that require the player to be in first-person to read them (like the scout guide book)
* Camera seems to be casting a weird little circular shadow
* Player's own backpack doesn't render when wearing on back

## Bugs / Contact
Report bugs and feature requests on the repository page here: https://github.com/mrpropellers/Peak.StableThirdPersonCamera/issues
Things which are not bugs or issues with the mod or I cannot reproduce easily will be closed without comment. If there is something you really think needs to be addressed, including a video of the problem is the best way to get it prioritized.
