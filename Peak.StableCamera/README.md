# Stable Camera
Stabilizes the camera and uses contextual third-person views to prevent motion sickness.
Press *N* (configurable) to toggle the stabilization on or off in-game. Stabilization is on by default.

in the BepInEx folder or in the mod manager.

	- The shortcut key which toggles the mod on or off in-game.

	- Reduce camera wobble using stabilized tracking. Disable this if head clipping is more annoying than wobble.
