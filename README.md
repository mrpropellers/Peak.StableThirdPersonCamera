# Stable Third Person Camera
From the same guy who brought you Another Crab's Treasure's very cool and normal camera: 
It's a wonky third-person camera for PEAK!! Based on linkoid's stabilization code,
extended to keep the camera in third person all the time.

Press *N* (configurable) to toggle the camera on/off in-game.

## Configuration
* Mostly you can just turn it on and off. Note that once you turn it ON, the first-person camera will be in a partially
 broken state even if you turn it off again. You'll need to start a new run with it OFF to fully restore the original camera
* There are some other settings for FoV and camera distance, but I have already set the defaults to the best values so I wouldn't worry about it

## Known Issues
* Binoculars don't work right
* Camera gets jumpy around especially pointy rocks and really narrow spaces
* Camera seems to be casting a weird little circular shadow
* Player's own backpack doesn't render when wearing on back
* End-game sequence probably looks weird (I haven't beat the game with the mod enabled lol)

## Bugs / Contact
Report bugs and feature requests on the repository page here: https://github.com/mrpropellers/Peak.StableThirdPersonCamera/issues or
yell at me on bsky: https://bsky.app/profile/leftout.itch.io (I will probably tell you to go make an issue on github)
If there is something you really think needs to be addressed, including a video of the problem is the best way to get it prioritized.
