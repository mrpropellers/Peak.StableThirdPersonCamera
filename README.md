### Hi folks. This plug-in isn't working right now. As soon as I figure out why I'll push an update up.

# Stable Third Person Camera
From the guy who worked at Aggro Crab for like 3 months to make Another Crab's Treasure's very cool and normal camera that never does anything weird: 
it's a stabilized third-person camera for PEAK!! Based on linkoid's stabilization code,
extended to keep the camera in third person all the time.

Press *N* (configurable) to toggle the camera on/off in-game.

## Configuration
C O M I N G  S O O N

## Known Issues
* No handling for text-having objects that require the player to be in first-person to read them (like the scout guide book)
* Camera seems to be casting a weird little circular shadow
* Player's own backpack doesn't render when wearing on back
* Binoculars probably don't work (haven't seen em yet)

## Bugs / Contact
Report bugs and feature requests on the repository page here: https://github.com/mrpropellers/Peak.StableThirdPersonCamera/issues
Things which are not bugs or issues with the mod or I cannot reproduce easily will be closed without comment. If there is something you really think needs to be addressed, including a video of the problem is the best way to get it prioritized.
