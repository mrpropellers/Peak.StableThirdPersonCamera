# Stable Third Person Camera
From the same guy who brought you Another Crab's Treasure's very cool and normal camera: 
It's a wonky third-person camera for PEAK!! Based on linkoid's stabilization code,
extended to keep the camera in third person all the time.

Press *N* (configurable) to toggle the camera on/off in-game.

## Configuration
TODO: Right now, most of the config values are inherited from linkoid's StableCamera mod and don't really do anything. 
I'll fix that eventually. 

## Known Issues
* Binoculars don't work right
* Camera gets jumpy around pointy rocks
* No handling for text-having objects that require the player to be in first-person to read them
* Camera seems to be casting a weird little circular shadow
* Player's own backpack doesn't render when wearing on back

Report bugs and feature requests on the repository page here: https://github.com/mrpropellers/Peak.StableThirdPersonCamera/issues or
yell at me on bsky: https://bsky.app/profile/leftout.itch.io (I will probably tell you to go make an issue on github)
If there is something you really think needs to be addressed, including a video of the problem is the best way to get it prioritized.
